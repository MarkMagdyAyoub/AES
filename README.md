# AES-128 Encryption Implementation

This project is a C++ implementation of the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It is designed for students who want to understand how AES encryption works and how to implement it in C++.

# Features:
✔ AES-128 encryption in C++

✔ File encryption and decryption support

✔ Hexadecimal conversions and transformations

✔ Key expansion and round operations

# Who is this for?
Students: Learn how AES encryption works.


# ⚠️ Important Notes

🚫 Not for Production: This implementation is for learning and experimentation only. It is not optimized for security or efficiency in real-world applications.

⚡ Needs Optimization: The code requires significant performance and memory optimizations to be suitable for practical use. "Improvements are planned for future updates 😊"

🔄 Decryption in Progress: Currently, only encryption is implemented. Decryption support is still under development.
